# pngcrush

Pngcrush is a command-line optimizer for PNG (Portable Network Graphics) files. 

Its main purpose is to reduce the size of the PNG IDAT datastream 
by trying various compression levels and PNG filter methods. 

It can also be used to remove unwanted ancillary chunks, 
or to add certain chunks including `gAMA`, `tRNS`, `iCCP`, and textual chunks.
